* [BlogApp Social App](https://github.com/drakoRRR/Blog_Website)

This project represents a comprehensive exploration of web development using Django, encompassing a wide range of 
essential features and technologies. Through this journey, we delved into building a robust authentication system, 
enabling users to effortlessly sign in or sign up. Moreover, we embraced the power of third-party services like Gmail 
for user registration, offering a seamless onboarding experience.
In addition, we leveraged Django Channels and WebSockets to implement a real-time chat feature, enhancing user engagement 
and interactivity. Our project primarily revolves around a blog, where we have integrated features such as adding friends, 
creating posts, and implementing a likes system to enrich the overall user experience.

* [ToDo Website](https://github.com/drakoRRR/ToDo_Django)

This website offers users the ability to add tasks with associated deadlines, tags, and descriptions. Additionally, 
it provides a simple mechanism for task deletion upon completion. Furthermore, the website have a real-time weather 
feature, displaying weather information based on the user's IP address. In the event the IP address is inaccessible, 
the weather data defaults to London's conditions.

* [ToDo API](https://github.com/drakoRRR/ToDo_API)

The ToDo API project was created for educational purposes to explore technologies like Python, Django, Django Rest Framework,
MySQL, Docker, and JWT-Auth for authentication. It offers users the ability to manage tasks and categories:

Users can retrieve, update, create, and delete tasks through specific endpoints. Completed 
tasks can be retrieved. Tasks can be filtered by category. Superusers can check, update, create, and 
delete categories. The project utilizes Docker for easy deployment and JWT for secure authentication, making 
it a valuable educational experience in web development and API creation.
