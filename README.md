* [BlogApp Social App](https://github.com/drakoRRR/Blog_Website)
This project represents a comprehensive exploration of web development using Django, encompassing a wide range of 
essential features and technologies. Through this journey, we delved into building a robust authentication system, 
enabling users to effortlessly sign in or sign up. Moreover, we embraced the power of third-party services like Gmail 
for user registration, offering a seamless onboarding experience.
In addition, we leveraged Django Channels and WebSockets to implement a real-time chat feature, enhancing user engagement 
and interactivity. Our project primarily revolves around a blog, where we have integrated features such as adding friends, 
creating posts, and implementing a likes system to enrich the overall user experience.

This website offers users the ability to add tasks with associated deadlines, tags, and descriptions. Additionally, 
it provides a simple mechanism for task deletion upon completion. Furthermore, the website have a real-time weather 
feature, displaying weather information based on the user's IP address. In the event the IP address is inaccessible, 
the weather data defaults to London's conditions.
